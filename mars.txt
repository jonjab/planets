Jon's mars notes____________

Cold and dry but everything is my favorite color.
The moons may be a problem for the Wolfman (because he's a werewolfe)
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity.
Alternatives include making a base on Venus since the atmosphere will block out the Moon. 
Mummy disagrees because of the toxic humidity.
How about Mercury? Or is that too close?
